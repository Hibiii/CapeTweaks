# CapeTweaks

A Fabric mod that changes the physics of vanilla capes with configuration.

In the future, CapeTweaks will let you filter out specific capes, like the migrator cape.

This mod does not add capes.

## Turbo Thanks

Thanks @BuzzFeedMinecraft for helping me fix the mixins early on!
I've- I've probably spent over 26 waking hours on it alone and an outside perspective was all I needed.

## To do

  - [ ] Add cape filtering in a way that's not laggy like you know, don't look up a map for a very long string every frame for every player!

## License

This mod is available under the Unlicense. Feel free to learn from it and incorporate it in your own projects.
